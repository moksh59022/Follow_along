### Milestone 34: Validating JWT Token from Cookie 🔐

✅ Extracting JWT from Cookie  
- Retrieved the JWT token from the browser’s cookie storage.  
- Sent the token to the backend with each request.

✅ JWT Token Validation  
- Created a middleware in the backend to validate the incoming JWT token.  
- Used `verify()` method from `jsonwebtoken` to decode and verify token authenticity.  

✅ Route Protection  
- Applied the JWT validation middleware to secure routes.  
- Ensured only authenticated users can access protected pages.

✅ Benefits  
- Enhances app security by verifying token on every request.  
- Prevents unauthorized access to sensitive routes and pages.
