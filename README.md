# Milestone 12: Product Page Implementation üöÄ

## Overview
In this milestone, I developed the **Product Page** that displays products created by the logged-in user. If a user creates a product on the **Create Product Page** using their email ID, it will be visible on their **Product Page**.

## Key Features ‚úÖ
- **User-Specific Product Display**: Products created using a particular email ID are shown on the corresponding user's Product Page.
- **Dynamic Fetching**: The page fetches product data from the backend dynamically.
- **Seamless Integration**: Integrated with the existing product creation and authentication system.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Frontend Enhancements
- **Product Page Component**: Designed a dedicated page to display user-specific products.
